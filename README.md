# NLP-Project-Caranx-Medical-World-AI-Festival

Medical NLP project to predict pacemaker requirements, presented at World AI Festival in Cannes.

Annotated 600 medical reports to predict whether a patient requires a heart pacemaker or not.

Developed a custom machine learning model and leveraged CamemBERT LLM to enhance performance.

This challenge was originally assigned to PhD students at INRIA, but I was the only master's student who participated.

Successfully presented our findings at the World AI Festival in Cannes.
